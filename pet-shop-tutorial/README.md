# ETHEREUM PET SHOP

This tutorial will take you through the process of building your first dapp—an adoption tracking system for a pet shop!  

This tutorial is meant for those with a basic knowledge of Ethereum and smart contracts, who have some knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, but who are new to dapps.  

### In this tutorial we will be covering:  

1.Setting up the development environment  
2.Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box  
3.Writing the smart contract  
4.Compiling and migrating the smart contract  
5.Testing the smart contract  
6.Creating a user interface to interact with the smart contract  
7.Interacting with the dapp in a browser  

### Background
Pete Scandlon of Pete's Pet Shop is interested in using Ethereum as an efficient way to handle their pet adoptions. The store has space for 16 pets at a given time, and they already have a database of pets. As an initial proof of concept, Pete wants to see a dapp which associates an Ethereum address with a pet to be adopted.

The website structure and styling will be supplied. Our job is to write the smart contract and front-end logic for its usage.

### Setting up the development environment
There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following:

Node.js v6+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)  
Git
